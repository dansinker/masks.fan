AirPops are expensive, and thinking you're getting the same in a $6 mask as a $60 mask can be frustratng, so here's a basic guide.

pocket = cheapest seal, foam around the nose

light se = silicon around the nose

original & active = same airpop filter, different outer shell

the airpop filter = silicone seal around the entire mask
